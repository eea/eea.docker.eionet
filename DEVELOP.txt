- You should use the devel-compose.yml for development:

  # docker-compose -f devel-compose.yml up -d

There are two services: plone and zeoserver. To use the plone service, use the
enter_devel.sh script:

  # ./enter_devel.sh

Inside the Plone container, you can use the instance script to start Zope:

  $ bin/instance fg

To avoid problems, you should use the ``plone`` user inside the container:

  $ su - plone

If you need to change the site.cfg you need to rebuild the image:

  # docker-compose -f devel-compose.yml rm plone
  # docker-compose -f devel-compose.yml build plone
  # docker-compose -f devel-compose.yml up -d plone
  # ./enter_devel.sh

Another method is to do the rebuild from inside the container:

  $ bin/develop rb

If you do the rebuild, by mistake, as root, you need to fix permissions:

  $ chown -R 500 /plone/instance /data

After that you need to use the docker-initialise.py script to reset the
configuration file as a zeoclient (by default the config files are created as
standalone instance):

  $ /docker-initialise.py
